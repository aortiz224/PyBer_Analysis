# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

## Resources
Data Source: [City Data CSV File](Resources/city_data.csv), [Ride Data CSV File](Resources/ride_data.csv)

Software: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib 3.3.2

## Results :oncoming_taxi:

From the PyBer Summary DataFrame, you can gather that the Urban city type has the most drivers and the most rides. However, the avergae fare per driver and avergae fare per ride are lower than in the suburban and rural areas.

Based on the research gathered, the figure below shows the total fares by city type. Urban cities are consistently greater than for suburban and rural areas. This is mainly due to people living in urban areas using the ride-sharing service at a greater frequency. Urban areas tend to have more activities (e.g. entertainment, restaurant, etc.) going on at all times as opposed to suburban areas and to a greater extent, rural areas, tend to shut down much earlier. 

Interesting enough, there's a small spike in all three city types around the end of February and early April. This coincides with the winter break and Easter break at generally Public Schools. This important detail shows that as children are out of school, people tend to go out more to keep the children entertain and may increase the usage of ride sharing services to persue their interests.

## Summary
The following are some recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types:

1 Consider increasing the number of drivers in the rural areas during 'peak' times (e.g. during Febraury/April breaks)

2 If the number of drivers cannot be increased, consider implementing rider loyalty program where a rider from each city type could earn points that gives them a future benefit (e.g. discount on future rides). This will maintain customer loyalty and reduce the fare for loyal customers.

3 Provide an incentive for new customers to expand customer base. For example, 3 free rides after first 10 rides. This will expand the network with the idea of retaining these new customers.
